<h2>State Meangment :</h2>
<p>
  ```bash
                                           
       State Management :
      => State management in Dart and Flutter is all about managing the data that the app will render and how it will respond to user input.
      State :
      => State is information that (1) can be read synchronously when the widget is built and (2) might change during the lifetime of the widget.
      SetState :
      => Rebuild the our stateful or stateless widget build method.
```</p>

       Defination :

  
        Provider is a Flutter library created by the community that simplifies the management of stateful information in widgets. 
        It's designed to work well with Flutter's reactive framework, allowing you to propagate and consume changes to state efficiently

```bash

           Explanation:

              In Flutter, managing state is crucial for building interactive and responsive applications.
              State can be anything from user authentication status to data fetched from a remote server or local storage
              . The traditional approach involves passing state down the widget tree manually, which can lead to complex and error-prone code, 
              especially in larger applications.
  
   ```
```bash
              Key Concepts:

              Providers: These are classes that contain the state and logic of your application. They act as the single source of truth for specific pieces of state.
              
              Consumers: Widgets that listen to changes in providers and rebuild themselves when the state they depend on changes.
              
              Providers Scope: Providers can be scoped to different parts of your application, allowing you to manage local and global state as needed.
              
              Why Use Provider:
              
              Simplicity: It simplifies state management by reducing boilerplate code.
              Performance: Provider is optimized for performance and works seamlessly with Flutter's reactive updates.
              Flexibility: It supports different types of state management patterns, such as ChangeNotifier, ValueNotifier, and more.
```
